# AI/LLM Security Repository

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to enhancing the security of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). It serves as a resource hub for researchers, developers, and security professionals working to identify, mitigate, and prevent threats specific to AI and LLM deployments.

## Features

- **Threat Landscape:** A comprehensive analysis of AI-specific vulnerabilities, such as prompt injection, model theft, data poisoning, and more.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** Best practices, tools, and techniques for securing LLMs against adversarial threats.
- **Case Studies:** Real-world examples of AI/LLM attacks with insights into how they were executed and mitigated.
- **Tools and Scripts:** Scripts and utilities for testing and hardening AI systems, including adversarial input generators, data sanitization tools, and monitoring frameworks.
- **Guidelines:** Step-by-step guides for implementing robust security controls in AI workflows.
- **GRC Policies:** Documentation on Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) policies tailored for AI systems, ensuring alignment with organizational and regulatory requirements.

## Contents
